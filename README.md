# Hostel_Room_Registration_Oop_cpp
This project is a C++ application for managing hostel room allocations for students. It includes user authentication, room selection by year and type (AC/Non-AC), and payment processing. Room data is managed via text files for different hostels (Ganga, Vedhavathi, Narmadha, Godhavari, Krishna). The system ensures efficient room management.
